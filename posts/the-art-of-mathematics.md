Math is like a staircase, each stair built ontop of another. Iâ€™ve always been intrigued by this system, attempting to derive my own explanations for what we learned in class, without the assistance of others. For to climb the stair myself, without any railing reminds me of the true nature of the stairs, a structure that builds itself through pure logic.
